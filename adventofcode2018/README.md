### adventofcode2018
This is my attempt to solve the problems presented by [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2018).  All problems belong to Advent of Code.  All solutions are my own.

The repository is separated into one folder per day.  Each folder contains the problem, any provided files, and my solution in Python.
